# officersmanual

Repository for an eventual handbook for HCMID club officers.

Initially, we can just brain-dump notes into the notes folder.  It would be easiest if we could keep notes in plain text format using markdown for any structure we need.  It would be helpful if we named files with `.md` extension.

Later, we can organize notes into something like a manual, and add a build file to generate web sites and pdf versions.

## Topics to consider ##

We need notes on everything connected with running the club including:

- how to recertify the club with OSI
- how to get a budget for the coming year
- how to spend funds
- how to reserve vans for travel
- how we manage version control of the club constitution
- connecting with Eta Sigma Phi re: Classics Day
- running a club web site, and other outreach
- what your advisor will know:  nothing

If you have any experience with or insight into any of those topics, dump a note in the notes folder!
