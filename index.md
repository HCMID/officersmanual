title: HC MID Officers' manual
---


We have not yet published a complete draft of the proposed manual for HC MID officers.

Clone or browse the repo at <https://github.com/HCMID/officersmanual>, and help us get this wrapped up!

So far, we have:

- an outline of some ideas in the repo [README](https://github.com/HCMID/officersmanual/blob/master/README.md)
- thorough notes from Becky Musgrave for the [2013-2014 academic year](https://github.com/HCMID/officersmanual/blob/master/notes/notes_fromBecky.md)
- notes on [how to run the ΗΣΦ Manuscript Challenge](https://github.com/HCMID/officersmanual/blob/master/notes/ClassicsDay_ManuscriptChallenge.md)
